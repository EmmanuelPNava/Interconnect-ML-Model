# Interconnect-ML-Model
The telecommunications company, Interconnect, would like to predict if a client is at risk of canceling the service. If they find users planning to leave, they will offer promotions and offers to retain the customers.  Our task is to develop a machine-learning model to predict customer churn. Interconnect expects a minimum AUC-ROC value of 0.88.
